# Card sort report

The reason I did this card sort was to see how someone else would organize my content for my large data website.

- Sylvia McCaley

*Card sort 2 by Celta Riden*

## Observations

- Both people seemed to sort the cards the same way
- Celta combined what Sylvia put into two categories (bascis and culte) she put into *about skateboarding*
- The results where what I expected because it is pretty straight forward information
- I felt confident that they would put them into the same kind of sections I would.
