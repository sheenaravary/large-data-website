# History of Skateboarding

Since I was young I have been interesting in skateboaridng. My brother skated all the time and I loved watching him. I have always found myseld surrounded by skaters. 

## Purpose

This project is to explore the history of skateboarding, and make a large-scale website with this information. 

I think github is an amazing app that allows us to publish websites without the commitment of paying for a site.
