        <h1><strong>The Ollie</strong></h1>
				<p class="hero-unit-p hero-unit-p-m hero-unit-p-l hero-unit-p-xl">The ollie is a skateboarding trick where the rider and board leap into the air without the use of the rider's hands. Particularly on flat ground, it is not intuitively obvious how the liftoff is achieved, making the trick visually striking. The ollie is a fundamental trick in street skateboarding, and is used to leap onto, over, or off obstacles, or over gaps of unfriendly terrain such as grass or stairs. As so many other tricks depend on it - for example the kickflip and heelflip - the ollie is often the first trick to be learned by a new skateboarder. The ollie typically takes considerable practice to learn.</p>

		<h2>How to Ollie</h2>
			<div class="numbered-list numbered-list-m numbered-list-left-l">
				<ol>
					<li>Stand on the board. Get a good feel for its shape, the tightness of your trucks, and the size of your wheels. Ollies are always easier on a familiar setup. If your trucks are too loose and you can't keep in control while crouching, then tighten them until things are a bit smoother.</li>
					<li>Adjust your feet with your front foot near the middle of the board and your back foot on the tail of the board. Getting the foot positioning right can be the first really tricky part of an ollie to master. The ball of your back foot should be half hanging off the edge of the deck's tail, or back. The ball of your front foot should be central to the deck, somewhere between the bolts.</li>
					<li>Bend your knees and crouch down. Start off in a stationary position. Balancing your crouch properly is crucial. Don't bend your back too much and don't stick your bottom out too far. Try to drop down and keep your shoulders level with your feet.</li>
					<li>Jump into the air, first with your front foot, and after with your back foot. The board isn't going anywhere with your weight on it, so the beginning of an ollie maneuver is to jump. Sometimes it's easier to think of it as jumping off of your back foot. If you're having trouble with the height of your ollie, just forget about sliding (for the moment) and slam your knees into your chest.</li>
				</ol>

				<ol start="5">
					<li>Jump up, and kick down the back of your board at the same time. A good strong pop is very important; it's the power behind your ollie. It's called a pop because of the noise of your deck hitting the ground, which will make it bounce.</li>
					<li>Slide your front foot as soon as you start jumping. Turn your front foot inward and slide up the front of the board in a rolling motion. Bring your back leg up toward your chest as you do this.</li>
					<li>Pull your knees up towards your chest. Exactly how far you need to do this depends on how high your ollie is, but the board can only go as high as your feet, so if you want your ollie to be high you have to bring those feet up.</li>
					<li>Level out with both when your front foot has slid all the way up, keeping pressure on the board as it begins to fall down. Make the board level to the ground while in mid-air. In other words, don't have the front of the board sticking up in mid-air. This technique will help tremendously when you get to jumping gaps.</li>
					<li>Try to land both feet at the same time, preferably with your feet as close to their respective trucks as possible. If you land an ollie with both feet in the middle of your deck, it's going to snap. Likewise, if you land on your nose and tail, they could break off. Make sure you bend your knees to absorb the shock when you land.</li>

				<p class="unit-p unit-p-m unit-p-l unit-p-xl">Flip tricks are a subset of aerials which are all based on the ollie. An example is the kickflip, the most widely known and performed flip trick.</p>
